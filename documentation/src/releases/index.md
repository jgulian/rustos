# Releases

The release cycle has several phases. They are modeled after the linux release cycle. Take a release `x.y.z`.

Major releases are increases in the `x` portion. These mark significant releases in the operating system. A `1.0.0`
release is not planned for the near future, but will likely entail significant improvement over the current kernel.

Minor releases are increases in the `y` portion. These mark new a decent number of working features to the kernel.

Releases with even `z` releases are refinements. In these releases, the focus is cleaning, testing, and generally
refining the project. New features, if added are not going to be big in these releases.

Releases with odd 'z' releases are developments. In these releases, the focus is prototyping, ideation, and development.
New features will be added in these releases, but they may not be quality features.

## Unstable

The kernel is unstable and will remain unstable for the foreseeable future. This is an experimental operating system,
so as I build features, it does not mean they will remain in the kernel in the future.
