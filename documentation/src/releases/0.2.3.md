# Release 0.2.3

Release 0.2.3 focused on user level abstractions for the filesystem.

Work on the release started by making the filesystem writable. Once this was completed, the filesystem was migrated to a
new for the kernel. This was done because the previous api did not make sense for the virtual filesystem. Once the new
filesystem api was done, the virtual filesystem was completed.

Then, changes to syscalls were made including adding `open`, `read`, `write`, and `duplicate` (or "dup"). These allowed
users to interact with the filesystem. However, there was still work to be done, so next `fork`, `exec`, and `wait` were
added. These syscalls allowed processes to make new processes. The final focus of the release was adding user programs,
specifically this release added `cat`, `echo`, `heap` (a test program to run the `sbrk` syscall), `init` (the first
program, which starts),`shell` (where users write programs), and `stack` (to do analysis of the initialization of the
stack).

## Notes

Originally elf files were going to be in this release, but it was decided they were outside the scope of the release.
Because of this, user arguments are in an unstable state, and will likely have the layout changed to match the elf
standard

The filesystem is also not in a completely stable state, but this will be changed in the cleanup release.
